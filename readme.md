Hello World! :grinning: I'm Igor Azevedo, i have 28 years old and i'm a novice developer. :wave:

I am a lawyer for 5 years, but i never love it, and now i'm returning to a old passion, programming.
My first contact with a programming language was in a web-design course in 2008, who introduce me to html, php and css.
Of course, it was only introductory, and unfortunately I moved away from programming.
But now, as a student of systems analysis and development :computer:, I hope to gain more knowledge in programming that i set aside a few years ago and develop things.
